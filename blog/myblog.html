      <p>Born in Paris and brought up in Oxfordshire, Watson attended the Dragon School and trained as an actress at the Oxford branch of Stagecoach Theatre Arts.

Her other roles include Regression (2015), Colonia (2015) and The Circle (2017).

From 2011 to 2014, Watson split her time between working on film projects and continuing her education, studying at Brown University and Worcester College, Oxford and graduating from Brown with a bachelor's degree in English literature in May 2014.[9] Her modelling work has included campaigns for Burberry and Lanc√¥me.[10][11] As a fashion consultant, she helped create a line of clothing for People Tree.[12] She was honoured by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 2014, winning for British Artist of the Year.[13] That same year, she was appointed as a UN Women Goodwill ambassador and helped launch the UN Women campaign HeForShe, which calls for men to advocate gender equality.[14]</p>
